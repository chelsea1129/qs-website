                    <p>I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/degree-programs/phd/human-centered-computing" target="_blank">Human-Centered Computing</a> at <a href="http://www.gatech.edu" target="_blank">Georgia Tech</a>. I am working with <a href="http://dilab.gatech.edu/ashok-k-goel/" target="_blank">Dr. Ashok K. Goel</a> at the <a href="http://dilab.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Design&Intelligence Lab (DILab)</a>. I am a human-centered AI researcher working at the intersection of Human-AI Interaction, Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), and Cognitive Science. In my Ph.D. research, I posit the Mutual Theory of Mind framework, inspired by our basic human capability to surmise what is happening in others' minds (also known as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind" target="_blank">Theory of Mind</a>"), to enhance mutual understanding between humans and AIs during human-AI communication. My work specifically focuses on the human-AI communication process during AI-mediated social interaction in online learning, where AI agents can connect socially isolated online learners by providing personalized social recommendations to online learners based on information extracted from students' posts on the online class discussion forums. 
                
                    <p>I received my bachelor of science degree from <a href="http://www.washington.edu/" target="_blank">University of Washington, Seattle</a> in <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/informatics" target="_blank">informatics</a> and <a href="http://www.psych.uw.edu" target="_blank">psychology</a>. I worked closely with the <a href="https://www.hcde.washington.edu" target="_blank">Department of Human-Centered Design and Engineering</a>, <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu" target="_blank">the Information School</a>, <a href="https://dub.washington.edu" target="_blank">the DUB group</a>, and <a href="http://www.psych.uw.edu" target="_blank">the psychology department</a> on several research projects during my undergraduate study. </p>

                    <p>I love indoor bouldering, hiking, and playing with my cat Gouda. </p>

                        <p></p>
                        <p>This project is an individual project advised by Dr. Debra Kaysen and was presented at the 2016 Undergraduate Research Symposium at University of Washington. Women who experienced sexual assault are 2 – 3 times more likely to experience sexual revictimization (SR). Factors that predict risk of SR include emotion dysregulation, guilt, and lower heart rate reactivity when facing sexual threats. These factors overlap with tonic immobility (TI), which is characterized by victim’s diminished or absent physical or vocal response during sexual assault ( “freeze” response).  Post-traumatic maladaptive cognitions also may increase risk for SR, either directly or through increasing risk of TI. Based on prior literature, my hypotheses are: 1. Higher TI will predict higher SV risk; 2. More severe maladaptive cognitions will predict higher SV risk; 3. TI will be predicted by maladaptive cognitions. Research findings suggest that prevention efforts may want to target women who experienced prior TI as a means of preventing future revictimization. These prevention efforts may be more effective if they include cognitive interventions.</p>
