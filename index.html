                    <p>I am a first-year PhD student in <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/degree-programs/phd/human-centered-computing" target="_blank">Human-Centered Computing</a> at <a href="http://www.gatech.edu" target="_blank">Georgia Tech</a> specializing in Cognitive Science and Human-Computer Interaction. I'm working with <a href="http://dilab.gatech.edu/ashok-k-goel/" target="_blank">Dr. Ashok Goel</a> at the <a href="http://dilab.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Design&Intelligence Lab (DILab)</a>. My research focuses on human-AI interaction in the context of education. My research centers around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbCguICyfTA" target="_blank">Jill Watson</a>, a virtual teaching assistant operating on Piazza forum answering students' questions and I am interested in the impact of Jill Watson on students as well as her "colleagues" -- the human TAs. My previous research focused on health informatics and patient-provider collaboration.

                    <p>I received my bachelor of science degree from <a href="http://www.washington.edu/" target="_blank">University of Washington, Seattle</a> in <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/informatics" target="_blank">informatics</a> and <a href="http://www.psych.uw.edu" target="_blank">psychology</a>. I worked closely with the <a href="https://www.hcde.washington.edu" target="_blank">Department of Human-Centered Design and Engineering</a>, <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu" target="_blank">the Information School</a>, <a href="https://dub.washington.edu" target="_blank">the DUB group</a>, and <a href="http://www.psych.uw.edu" target="_blank">the psychology department</a> on numerous research projects during my undergraduate study. At UW, I worked in areas such as personal health informatics, patient-provider collaboration, user value scale, computing education, disaster information management, and health and risky behaviors.

                    <p>In my free time, I like to frequent gym, art museums, cat cafes, bookstores, and ceramics painting shops.</p>

                            <p>The prevalence use of technology has helped people to generate personal data such as sleep, activity on their own. For patient with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) it is crucial for them to know what kinds of food would trigger their discomfort. Some patients chose to record their food intake by writing a food diary and show providers the diary during their session. However, food diary is extremely hard to read and gather data efficiently during a 15-minute patient-provider session. To support patient and provider's collaboration, we designed a photo-based food diary which will help patient to collect data more engagingly and efficiently, and also help providers to give suggestions efficiently. </p>

                            <p>We previously investigated the factors that constitutes user burdens in computing technologies and developed a scale to measure the burden certain systems cast on users. But we found that for certain systems, even though the burden is really high, users still continue to use it. We believe that there are certain values in systems that will motivate users' sustain usage.

                                For this project we are trying to find different values users see in computing technologies, how they are affecting users choices of technology adoption, and finding a way to measure them.</p>

                                ​
                                Women who experienced sexual assault are 2 – 3 times more likely to experience sexual revictimization (SR). Factors that predict risk of SR include emotion dysregulation, guilt, and lower heart rate reactivity when facing sexual threats. These factors overlap with tonic immobility (TI), which is characterized by victim’s diminished or absent physical or vocal response during sexual assault ( “freeze” response).  Post-traumatic maladaptive cognitions also may increase risk for SR, either directly or through increasing risk of TI.
                                
                                Based on prior literature, my hypotheses are: 1. Higher TI will predict higher SV risk; 2. More severe maladaptive cognitions will predict higher SV risk; 3. TI will be predicted by maladaptive cognitions.
                                
                                Research findings suggest that prevention efforts may want to target women who experienced prior TI as a means of preventing future revictimization. These prevention efforts may be more effective if they include cognitive interventions.</p>
